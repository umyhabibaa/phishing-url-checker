# Phishing URL Checker - Web Frontend

A modern, responsive web application for detecting potential phishing URLs. This is the frontend version of the original Python Tkinter application, designed to be deployed as a static site on Vercel.

## Features

- üîç **URL Analysis**: Checks URLs for common phishing indicators
- üõ°Ô∏è **Security Checks**: Validates domains, IP addresses, and suspicious patterns
- üì± **Responsive Design**: Works perfectly on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- ‚ö° **Fast Performance**: Client-side analysis with instant results
- üé® **Modern UI**: Beautiful, intuitive interface with smooth animations
- üîí **Security Headers**: Configured with proper security headers for production

## What It Checks

- **IP Addresses**: Detects URLs using IP addresses instead of domains
- **Subdomain Analysis**: Identifies suspicious subdomain patterns
- **Keyword Detection**: Scans for common phishing keywords
- **Trusted Domains**: Verifies against a list of known trusted domains
- **URL Shorteners**: Warns about shortened URLs that could hide destinations
- **Typosquatting**: Detects common domain typos
- **Protocol Security**: Checks for insecure HTTP connections

## File Structure

```
phising_tool/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ index.html          # Main HTML file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ styles.css          # CSS styles and responsive design
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ script.js           # JavaScript logic and URL analysis
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ vercel.json         # Vercel deployment configuration
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This file
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ phishing _tool.py   # Original Python application
```

## Configuration

The application uses the same detection logic as the original Python version:

- **Suspicious Keywords**: `["login", "verify", "update", "secure", "account", "banking"]`
- **Trusted Domains**: `["paypal.com", "google.com", "microsoft.com", "bankofamerica.com", "canvas.fau.edu"]`

You can modify these in `script.js` to customize the detection rules.

## Security Features

The `vercel.json` file includes security headers:

- `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff`
- `X-Frame-Options: DENY`
- `X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block`
- `Referrer-Policy: strict-origin-when-cross-origin`

## Browser Support

- Chrome 60+
- Firefox 55+
- Safari 12+
- Edge 79+

## Development

To run locally:

1. **Serve the files** using any static server:

   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000

   # Using Node.js
   npx serve .

   # Using PHP
   php -S localhost:8000
   ```

2. **Open in browser**: `http://localhost:8000`

## Customization

### Adding New Detection Rules

Edit `script.js` and modify the `analyzeUrl()` function:

```javascript
// Add new suspicious keywords
const SUSPICIOUS_KEYWORDS = [
  "login",
  "verify",
  "update",
  "secure",
  "account",
  "banking",
  "your-new-keyword",
];

// Add new trusted domains
const TRUSTED_DOMAINS = [
  "paypal.com",
  "google.com",
  "microsoft.com",
  "bankofamerica.com",
  "canvas.fau.edu",
  "your-trusted-domain.com",
];
```

### Styling Changes

Modify `styles.css` to change the appearance:

- Colors: Update CSS custom properties
- Layout: Modify grid and flexbox properties
- Animations: Adjust transition and animation values
